<h3>Design Thinking Tools</h3>

The most important thing is understanding that "iterative and non-linear process." 
That phrase means that the executing team can use the result of one stage to evaluate and improve a previous step.
This allows understanding the problem and redefining it when necessary, 
and creating new insights and alternative solutions that had not been thought of before.

<h3>Thinking outside the box</h3>

Design Thinking helps people think differently and from a new perspective. 
People who use this methodology develop the ability to:

:fast_forward: Think and solve problems in a different way than the most common methods.<br>
:fast_forward: Challenge assumptions.<br>
:fast_forward: Improve products, services, and processes.<br>
:fast_forward: Analyze and understand the interaction between users and products.<br>
:fast_forward: Question the conditions of a problem.<br>
